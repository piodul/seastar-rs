/// A macro intended for running asynchronous tests.
///
/// Tests are spawned in a separate thread.
/// This is done to ensure thread_local cleanup between them
/// (at the time of writing, Seastar doesn't do it itself).
///
/// # Usage
///
/// ```rust
/// #[seastar::test]
/// async fn my_test() {
///     assert!(true);
/// }
/// ```
